The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.Their bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.The girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine&#039;s accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster&#039;s wealth.

Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation&#039;s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku&#039;s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history.While this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast.(Source: Pelleas)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1471,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Jan 7, 1976","score":6.36,"members":587,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5274,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5274\/Magical\u2605Taruruuto-kun","title":"Magical\u2605Taruruuto-kun","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/17853.jpg?s=f8da50eea09186757cf437cc07ead0f8","synopsis":"Magical Taruruto-kun is a magical boy, fighting, and comedy TV show based on the manga of the same name by Tatsuya Egawa which ran in Weekly Shounen Jump.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":87,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi","name":"Ecchi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/16\/Magic","name":"Magic"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School","name":"School"}],"airing_start":"Sep 9, 1990, 08:30 (JST)","score":6.68,"members":564,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5249,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5249\/Mitsume_ga_Tooru","title":"Mitsume ga Tooru","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/10916.jpg?s=521804fa4addbd627facef8f6389fd9a","synopsis":"He is a little boy who has a terrible power.

The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \"symphonic poem\" or \"tone poem\" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.Tomita&#039;s symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.In 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza&#039;s capture and Panja&#039;s death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem&#039;s animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.(Source: kimbawlion.com)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse","name":"Madhouse"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids","name":"Kids"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Apr 1, 1991","score":6.73,"members":549,"kids":true,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":20385,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/20385\/Eguchi_Hisashi_no_Kotobuki_Gorou_Show","title":"Eguchi Hisashi no Kotobuki Gorou Show","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/54143.jpg?s=473ab3365958b671bcec829cd20ddf2a","synopsis":"Based on the gag manga by Hisashi Eguchi.Originally released as a feature part of Studio Pierrot&#039;s video magazine show Anime V Comic Rentaman (\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fbV\u30fb\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af \u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30de\u30f3) along with Abashiri Ikka, Yumemakura Baku Twilight Gekijou and Akai Hayate.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2\/Kyoto_Animation","name":"Kyoto Animation"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Studio_Pierrot","name":"Studio Pierrot"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":4,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi","name":"Ecchi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody","name":"Parody"}],"airing_start":"May 21, 1991","score":5.85,"members":490,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":12769,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/12769\/Yumemakura_Baku_Twilight_Gekijou","title":"Yumemakura Baku Twilight Gekijou","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/35855.jpg?s=759e2c8cb158b24d2952b7fb7297c72b","synopsis":"Originally released as a feature part of Studio Pierrot&#039;s video magazine show Anime V Comic Rentaman (\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fbV\u30fb\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af \u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30de\u30f3) along with Abashiri Ikka, Eguchi Hisashi no Kotobuki Gorou Show and Akai Hayate.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/567\/DAST","name":"D.A.S.T."},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Studio_Pierrot","name":"Studio Pierrot"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":4,"source":"Novel","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror","name":"Horror"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological","name":"Psychological"}],"airing_start":"May 21, 1991","score":5.65,"members":489,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":10353,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10353\/Okama_Hakusho","title":"Okama Hakusho","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/28453.jpg?s=aab5d2e236bc28de68cf0200fd4b25ea","synopsis":"Okama is a man who has some problems.
