The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation&#039;s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku&#039;s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history.While this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast.(Source: Pelleas)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1471,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Jan 7, 1976","score":6.36,"members":587,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":4083,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4083\/Wonder_Beat_Scramble","title":"Wonder Beat Scramble","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/4\/7436.jpg?s=227b5d43ef6d06c84e92c9c21ec91ea7","synopsis":"In 2119, the spaceship Green Sleeves found 3 planets attacked by X23, a moving planet heading Earth.

Tezuka Osamu crafts a love story in the time when humans are expanding into space at the end of the 21st century, employing an omnibus form similar to Bradbury&#039;s \"Martian Chronicle.\" The story line is similar to \"Phoenix: Nostalgia.\" Leaving the earth after marriage, a woman is left behind in space when her husband suddenly dies of a cosmic disease. These background details were used in \"The Phoenix\" as well. This time, her friends on the Earth head for space to save the woman who was once everyone&#039;s ideal lady. In this special animated piece, Tezuka Osamu emphasizes his basic concepts that \"love can save the earth\" and \"only love can save humans.\"(Source: Tezuka Osamu.net)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/200\/Tezuka_Productions","name":"Tezuka Productions"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery","name":"Mystery"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"}],"airing_start":"Aug 24, 1986","score":5.96,"members":481,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":8678,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8678\/Sangokushi_II__Amakakeru_Otoko-tachi","title":"Sangokushi II: Amakakeru Otoko-tachi","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/72949.jpg?s=c6a46e466e7e17bf9d3c8376a95e812b","synopsis":"The sequel to Sangokushi (1985).","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/247\/Shin-Ei_Animation","name":"Shin-Ei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Aug 22, 1986","score":6.77,"members":264,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false}]
