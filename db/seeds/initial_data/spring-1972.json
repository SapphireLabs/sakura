Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/191\/Eiken","name":"Eiken"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":null,"source":"4-koma manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)","score":6.3,"members":2576,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":8235,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8235\/Muumin_1972","title":"Muumin (1972)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/47155.jpg?s=cd3a2f8491979d753b16afd7e436e3f0","synopsis":"A remake of the 1969-70 Moomin series.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.Throughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production","name":"Tatsunoko Production"}],"licensor":["Saban Entertainment"],"episodes":52,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"}],"airing_start":"Jan 4, 1972","score":5.89,"members":953,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":6971,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6971\/Gegege_no_Kitarou_1971","title":"Gegege no Kitarou (1971)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/27399.jpg?s=b5ab1cb1c55751f99fc570814f86c06f","synopsis":"Kitarou, a ghost, spends his afterlife helping humans in need of his skills.
