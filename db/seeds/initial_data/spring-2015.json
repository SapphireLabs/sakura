Don&#039;t expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/191\/Eiken","name":"Eiken"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":null,"source":"4-koma manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)","score":6.3,"members":2576,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":6149,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6149\/Chibi_Maruko-chan_1995","title":"Chibi Maruko-chan (1995)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/13508.jpg?s=a4465bd946c243548e22cc207dcede99","synopsis":"Momoko Sakura is an elementary school student who likes popular idol Momoe Yamaguchi and mangas.

The place: Edo, now known as Tokyo.One of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.A much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.Third of Tetsuzo&#039;s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father&#039;s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \"We&#039;re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\"Decades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.However, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai&#039;s daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.(Source: Production I.G)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG","name":"Production I.G"}],"licensor":["GKIDS","NYAV Post"],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural","name":"Supernatural"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"}],"airing_start":"May 9, 2015","score":7.25,"members":13733,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":28881,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/28881\/New_Initial_D_Movie__Legend_2_-_Tousou","title":"New Initial D Movie: Legend 2 - Tousou","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/72246.jpg?s=d7b14054ad4f272e081e384d46d3ab31","synopsis":"The second movie in a trilogy.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/839\/LIDENFILMS","name":"LIDENFILMS"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/537\/SANZIGEN","name":"SANZIGEN"}],"licensor":["Sentai Filmworks"],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/3\/Cars","name":"Cars"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports","name":"Sports"}],"airing_start":"May 23, 2015","score":7.91,"members":8385,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":25729,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/25729\/Tamayura__Sotsugyou_Shashin_Part_1_-_Kizashi","title":"Tamayura: Sotsugyou Shashin Part 1 - Kizashi","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/71628.jpg?s=fa68f74069892eb7496dcc6e3531da3e","synopsis":"The first movie of a four-part finale of Tamayura.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/333\/TYO_Animations","name":"TYO Animations"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"}],"airing_start":"Apr 4, 2015","score":7.69,"members":5939,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":30790,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30790\/Yowamushi_Pedal__Re_ROAD","title":"Yowamushi Pedal: Re:ROAD","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/7\/86877.jpg?s=985e6f300c6e210f4e007cb8e6ff9d5a","synopsis":"The movie will compile the episodes from the second season of the anime, and will also have new cuts of animation.(Source: ANN)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment","name":"TMS Entertainment"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports","name":"Sports"}],"airing_start":"Jun 12, 2015","score":7.47,"members":4911,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":30617,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30617\/Animegatari","title":"Animegatari","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/73567.jpg?s=e44e28939b2a1a82d8abbac7182938e1","synopsis":"Short animation screened during intermission at TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1396\/W-Toon_Studio","name":"W-Toon Studio"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":6,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Apr 17, 2015","score":6.03,"members":2732,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":32476,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32476\/Love_Live_The_School_Idol_Movie__Gekijou_Manner_CM","title":"Love Live!
