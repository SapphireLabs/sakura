Witchcraft replaces science and technology and everyone makes use of it on their daily lives, except for Nobita, who, like usual, isn&#039;t very good at conjuring spells. Frustrated, he plans on returning things to their past state, but his mother threw the Moshimo-box away.One day, Doraemon and his friends meet Professor Mangetsu, who studies magic and magical beings such as goblins, and his daughter Miyoko, and are warned of the dangerous approximation of the \"star of the Underworld\" to the Earth&#039;s orbit.With the future of the planet at stake, the group must travel to the Underworld and pierce the heart of the Underworld King with a silver dart, as detailed in the ancient texts of \"The Chronicles of the Underworld\". Their attempts are, however, thwarted and Miyoko captured.Doraemon and his friends then decided to use the Time Machine to return to the past and, using Dorami&#039;s Moshimo-box, they manage to restore the Earth. The events on the Underworld continue, however, to take place in a Parallel Universe, where Miyoko is still captive. As a result, the group is once again forced to travel to the Underworld and defeat its tyrannical ruler once and for all.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/247\/Shin-Ei_Animation","name":"Shin-Ei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"}],"airing_start":"Mar 10, 2007","score":7.65,"members":2253,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":8551,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8551\/Dr_Slump_Movie_11__Dr_Mashirito___Abale-chan","title":"Dr. Slump Movie 11: Dr. Mashirito &amp; Abale-chan","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/23179.jpg?s=6580756b6f1a3b0adedb41ec2d035232","synopsis":"The story centers around an evil counterpart of Arale created by Dr. Mashirito named Abale.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Mar 3, 2007","score":5.99,"members":742,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":10005,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10005\/Tetsujin_28-gou__Hakuchuu_no_Zangetsu","title":"Tetsujin 28-gou: Hakuchuu no Zangetsu","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/7\/27668.jpg?s=621b5c92b56e22b8c57d898f20755949","synopsis":"This theatrical version based on the manga by Yokoyama Mitsuteru, deals with the genius boy detective Kaneda Shotaro and his giant robot, Tetsujin 28, set in Tokyo ten years after the end of the Second World War.Shotaro&#039;s missing brother appears as a a new character who was trained as a pilot of the soldier robot Tetsujin which Japan had created for the Second World War.
