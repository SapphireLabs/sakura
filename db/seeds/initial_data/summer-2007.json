Of course, there&#039;s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car&#039;s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner&#039;s death.

There&#039;s a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc.The \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn&#039;t really care about trains; she&#039;s cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he&#039;s completely gung-ho as long as he&#039;s following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining.Throughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you&#039;ve travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga!In addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There&#039;s always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there&#039;s really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":13,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"}],"airing_start":"Jun 24, 2007","score":6.5,"members":1556,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5276,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5276\/Happy_Happy_Clover","title":"Happy Happy Clover","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/17267.jpg?s=fcdb617c574841899a502f30f86c5f2b","synopsis":"Happy Happy Clover recounts the everyday life of a bunny named Chima and the other animals in the Crescent Moon Forest.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":13,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids","name":"Kids"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"}],"airing_start":"Jul 6, 2007, 16:30 (JST)","score":6.6,"members":784,"kids":true,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":269,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/269\/Bleach","title":"Bleach","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/3\/40451.jpg?s=7dc7a38ee858a9001bf762cdf96e2a2e","synopsis":"Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler\u2014until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls.

By the year 2050, Japan has firmly established itself as the leader in robotic technology and manufacture with Daiwa Heavy Industries. As the technology evolves to include robotic enhancements to the human body, the blurring of the line between man and machine triggers a sudden shift in world opinion. In response, the U.N. passes a unilateral ban of further research and development on robotics in 2067. Japan fiercely objects to this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdrew from international politics and chose to pursue a policy of high-tech national isolation. While only trade continues, Japan disappears from the world scene.Ten years later, a series of bizarre incidents lead the American technology police agency SWORD to believe that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies through the use of the RACE network. SWORD dispatches a unit of special agents to infiltrate Japan and gather intelligence on the country.
