While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth&#039;s natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity&#039;s main line of defense against the Neuroi.With normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.In due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"The Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.However, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual&#039;s consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.Experts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.This is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.(Source: Production I.G)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG","name":"Production I.G"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":26,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Apr 9, 2008, 00:59 (JST)","score":7.2,"members":18955,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1516,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1516\/Kirarin\u2606Revolution","title":"Kirarin\u2606Revolution","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/1\/1516.jpg?s=b7ad62987cad8f9598b15312b9e3d1d4","synopsis":"Kirari Tsukishima, a gluttonous 14-year-old beauty, is a girl who does not care about idols and the entertainment world because her mind is occupied by food.

Of course, there&#039;s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car&#039;s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner&#039;s death. The manga follows Akio&#039;s various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/179\/ACGT","name":"A.C.G.T."}],"licensor":[],"episodes":26,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/3\/Cars","name":"Cars"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports","name":"Sports"}],"airing_start":"Jun 15, 2007","score":7.51,"members":14003,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3859,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3859\/Top_Secret__The_Revelation","title":"Top Secret: The Revelation","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/21702.jpg?s=6b6292dbe67a17c633716edb59a15624","synopsis":"A newly developed method allows to display the memories of dead people.
