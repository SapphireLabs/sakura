While Japanese refugees were taken in by various countries, the Japanese government accepted aid from China and the United States, which eventually caused China to govern the North, and the USA to govern the South. 15 years later, the Japanese refugees residing in Taiwan and the Taiwanese citizens find themselves clashing with one another, due to job competition and the unimproving conditions of the Japanese refugees. Genichiro Ryu is a survivor of the catastrophic events that took place in Japan, but was raised in Taiwan by a couple who adopted him. He gets himself involved in the situation between the Taiwanese and the Japanese, hoping that the two parties will be able to coexist with one another.(Source: ANN)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse","name":"Madhouse"}],"licensor":["Maiden Japan"],"episodes":2,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Sep 17, 2006","score":7.05,"members":1759,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1790,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1790\/Tactical_Roar_Special","title":"Tactical Roar Special","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/11\/3401.jpg?s=adb58bbcd67337fb208170538181669b","synopsis":"DVD special.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi","name":"Ecchi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military","name":"Military"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Sep 26, 2006","score":5.93,"members":1398,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1903,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1903\/Stratos_4__Logbook","title":"Stratos 4: Logbook","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/8374.jpg?s=c3cbe1d250c5d2c31134ae25f5c7e8d4","synopsis":"Stratos 4 Recap episode - For everything which happened before Stratos 4 Advance started.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi","name":"Ecchi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Aug 26, 2006","score":6.43,"members":1217,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":30625,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30625\/Princess_Princess_Specials","title":"Princess Princess Specials","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/73602.jpg?s=a184fb03130376a1f6740e53ba43bca8","synopsis":"Short omake episodes included on the Blu-ray\/DVD volumes of Princess Princess.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/37\/Studio_Deen","name":"Studio Deen"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":12,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School","name":"School"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"}],"airing_start":"Jul 19, 2006","score":6.75,"members":1088,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":36825,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/36825\/Pokemon_Diamond___Pearl__Clip_Show","title":"Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl: Clip Show","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/9\/89042.jpg?s=88bccf9a8ee9f8a88ba2ace286c26817","synopsis":"A compilation of old clips from Satoshi&#039;s journeys.
