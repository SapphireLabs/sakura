However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama&#039;s award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.[Written by MAL Rewrite]","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/858\/Wit_Studio","name":"Wit Studio"}],"licensor":["Funimation"],"episodes":25,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military","name":"Military"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery","name":"Mystery"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power","name":"Super Power"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Apr 7, 2013, 01:58 (JST)","score":8.5,"members":1298634,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1735,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1735\/Naruto__Shippuuden","title":"Naruto: Shippuuden","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/17407.jpg?s=13249ce322298cb379bc8781b916c73e","synopsis":"It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger.

Kai reassures him that he is his own person, and Yamato confesses that after he met Mei, he realized just how lonely he was. Kai later runs into Megumi at the bus stop.
