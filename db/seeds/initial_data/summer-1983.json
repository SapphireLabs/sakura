The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation&#039;s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku&#039;s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history.While this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast.(Source: Pelleas)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1471,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Jan 7, 1976","score":6.36,"members":587,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":4244,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4244\/Ginga_Shippuu_Sasuraiger","title":"Ginga Shippuu Sasuraiger","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/7\/47491.jpg?s=7e4a57f6dd7bf32616568270a11f0d8d","synopsis":"It is 2911 and the solar system is made up of of 50 planets.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization\/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world&#039;s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (&#039;Bishounen-Killer&#039;) Bancoran. Bancoran&#039;s nickname doesn&#039;t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran&#039;s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour&#039;s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran&#039;s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang&#039;s Metropolis, while Jack&#039;s &#039;apartment&#039; bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst&#039;s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/28\/Shounen_Ai","name":"Shounen Ai"}],"airing_start":"Jul 10, 1983","score":6.84,"members":552,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":2258,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2258\/Choro_Q_Dagram","title":"Choro Q Dagram","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/1\/2493.jpg?s=fa32bdbe7f9f16e58cd42385633acd4f","synopsis":"Malcontents on the Deloyer colony agitate for the independence of their world from the Earth Federation.
