The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.Their bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.The girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine&#039;s accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster&#039;s wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron&#039;s troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle&#039;s dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production","name":"Tatsunoko Production"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":52,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"}],"airing_start":"Jul 29, 1990","score":7.22,"members":4755,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":2243,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2243\/Karasu_Tengu_Kabuto","title":"Karasu Tengu Kabuto","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/1\/2445.jpg?s=5da7ab10e432efff0325b8a0681cd043","synopsis":"500 years ago in the Tensho Era of Japan, a man was born who defied the will of a demon; a man who had gods of good on his side; a man destined to battle evil....his name was Kabuto.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation&#039;s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku&#039;s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history.While this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast.(Source: Pelleas)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1471,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Jan 7, 1976","score":6.36,"members":587,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":4928,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4928\/Idol_Tenshi_Youkoso_Youko","title":"Idol Tenshi Youkoso Youko","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/9469.jpg?s=589f824eb9306ff276ecbd7c0bc8819e","synopsis":"A young girl and her flying squirrel goes to Tokyo in hopes of becoming an idol singer.
