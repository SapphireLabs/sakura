The only way the key can be wound is by Zennosuke doing good deeds. In order to achieve this end, he is given the Dango-ken, which is a sword with Japanese Dumplings skewered onto it. Whenever Zenmai Zamurai sees people doing injustice or generally being out of control, he uses his sword to shoot the dumplings into their mouths. When the dumplings are eaten, the people suddenly become happy and realize the error of their ways. He helps out the people of his village in many ways, big and small. Whenever he has done well, a rainbow comes out of the sky to wind up his key.-Wikipedia","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/56\/A-1_Pictures","name":"A-1 Pictures"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":215,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids","name":"Kids"}],"airing_start":"Apr 3, 2006","score":null,"members":211,"kids":true,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":13177,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/13177\/Little_Charo","title":"Little Charo","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/10\/36885.jpg?s=d4062e051b779fe7d10ed74f9f71e90f","synopsis":"NHK&#039;s English education program featured the adventures of a puppy named Charo in New York.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":50,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"}],"airing_start":"Apr 2, 2008","score":null,"members":200,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5374,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5374\/Miracle_Mimika","title":"Miracle!
