A dangerous container is to be secretly loaded into medical transport ship which goes into the earth orbit because it&#039;s forbidden to store dangerous container on earth.It&#039;s so secret that no crew members on the ship were told about the container&#039;s contents or any possible hazzards. The truth is, the container carries a dangerous living body in some form like liquid \/ worm which is capable of reading DNA information of other living beings and then transforms itself as an exact copy. Of course, the original object then will be killed.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space","name":"Space"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"}],"airing_start":"Sep 6, 2002","score":4.55,"members":772,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":14367,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/14367\/Tenshi_na_Konamaiki_Specials","title":"Tenshi na Konamaiki Specials","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/39411.jpg?s=dd685ba8d46b13e0ec32184df776165e","synopsis":"Short DVD extras that feature Megu in various costumes and poses.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment","name":"TMS Entertainment"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":13,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Aug 21, 2002","score":6.26,"members":649,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":31494,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31494\/Mini-Chara_Macross","title":"Mini-Chara Macross","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/3\/75898.jpg?s=83dd5d51b196123f6ad20559cb08b7b2","synopsis":"Macross chibi special included on Macross 20th Anniversary Premium Collection DVD.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody","name":"Parody"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"}],"airing_start":"Aug 25, 2002","score":5.28,"members":469,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":23597,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23597\/Legend_of_Basara__Shinbashi_Theater","title":"Legend of Basara: Shinbashi Theater","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/61723.jpg?s=649d1d6e4044c52f1a2d30ee4aae3e5a","synopsis":"Short animation of Shinbashi inluded in the DVD release.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Sep 27, 2002","score":5.91,"members":252,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":20225,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/20225\/Umigame_to_Shounen","title":"Umigame to Shounen","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/53835.jpg?s=8494f281798282a32b091870af5d9729","synopsis":"The first film in Shin-Ei&#039;s series of annual WWII themed anime television movies for children \"Sensou Douwa\" (war story).(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/247\/Shin-Ei_Animation","name":"Shin-Ei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Aug 15, 2002","score":null,"members":152,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false}]
