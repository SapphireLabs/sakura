Unfortunately, half-human criminals means non-human clues that often leave the police stumped. That&#039;s where lone wolf detectives like Hiroshi Inaba come in. He&#039;s literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone&#039;s hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn&#039;t complaining much.) And it&#039;s nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba&#039;s nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba&#039;s sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he&#039;s going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat.
