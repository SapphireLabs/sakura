Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler.The main antagonist in the manga and anime was Tigers&#039; Den, a mysterious organization that trained young people to be villainous heel wrestlers on the condition that they gave half of their earnings to the organization.
