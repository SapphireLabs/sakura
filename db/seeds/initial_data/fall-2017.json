She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman&#039;s right to a career and to marry for love.(Source: ANN)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/22\/Nippon_Animation","name":"Nippon Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"}],"airing_start":"Nov 11, 2017","score":7.19,"members":5599,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":36444,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/36444\/Touken_Ranbu__Hanamaru_-_Makuai_Kaisouroku","title":"Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru - Makuai Kaisouroku","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/87948.jpg?s=d62843c7666bfb395711e06bd1eefed5","synopsis":"Recap movie of Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/95\/Doga_Kobo","name":"Doga Kobo"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Card game","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"}],"airing_start":"Dec 1, 2017","score":6.49,"members":3435,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":35949,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35949\/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Thunderbolt__Bandit_Flower","title":"Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: Bandit Flower","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/13\/87511.jpg?s=890a141483d04979496f4b3a17e56e3e","synopsis":"Compilation film for Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise","name":"Sunrise"}],"licensor":["NYAV Post"],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military","name":"Military"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space","name":"Space"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"}],"airing_start":"Nov 18, 2017","score":7.3,"members":2847,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":35880,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35880\/Yowamushi_Pedal__Re_Generation","title":"Yowamushi Pedal: Re:Generation","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/1926\/90708.jpg?s=43f426c839b2a8306d981b79f086c0a6","synopsis":"The summary movie compiling episodes from the 3rd season of the anime with some new scenes.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment","name":"TMS Entertainment"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports","name":"Sports"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Oct 13, 2017","score":6.96,"members":2502,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":36436,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/36436\/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__Twilight_Axis_-_Akaki_Zan-ei","title":"Mobile Suit Gundam: Twilight Axis - Akaki Zan-ei","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/87927.jpg?s=486a63673b99d976af2b8b440c79cf0a","synopsis":"Compilation film of Mobile Suit Gundam: Twilight Axis.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise","name":"Sunrise"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Novel","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military","name":"Military"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space","name":"Space"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"}],"airing_start":"Nov 18, 2017","score":6.27,"members":1381,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":35206,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35206\/Kirakira\u2606Precure_A_La_Mode_Movie__Paritto_Omoide_no_Mille-Feuille","title":"Kirakira\u2606Precure A La Mode Movie: Paritto!
