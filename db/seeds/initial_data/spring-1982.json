The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization\/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.(Source: aestheticism.com)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":49,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/28\/Shounen_Ai","name":"Shounen Ai"}],"airing_start":"Apr 9, 1982, 19:00 (JST)","score":7.61,"members":3321,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":518,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/518\/Mahou_no_Princess_Minky_Momo","title":"Mahou no Princess Minky Momo","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/56747.jpg?s=ac174f878297f5de1e4fdf5fe43e649f","synopsis":"Momo is the princess of Fenarinarsa, a land of dreams that is getting further and further from Earth.

The Earth is in a time of prosperity. The president of the Terran League (the \"Galaxy Alliance\" in Voltron) launches a mission to explore beyond the galaxy. After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.There are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as \"Rugger,\" which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union. The U.S. version would rename the \"Galbeston Empire\" to \"Drule Empire,\" along with editing a fair amount of violence and sexual content to keep the show safe for general audience broadcast.(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":52,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Mar 3, 1982","score":6.56,"members":1406,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3136,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3136\/Ochamegami_Monogatari__Korokoro_Pollon","title":"Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Pollon","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/60529.jpg?s=2d71664aa44c3cefb23ccf15e5ca2a0a","synopsis":"Anime about the funny lives of the Greek gods up on Mount Olympus.

Justin managed to sneak up on the two before the rain started pouring, forcing them to run for cover. They would eventually find a house in the wooded area, previously unseen according to Justin. At first glance it appeared nobody was home after entering the house, until they discovered a robot named Solar Ion Robot (Kadenchin), or the acronym SIR. They would soon meet the owner of the house, Professor Humphrey Bumble (Dr. Tokio Taimu), who introduced the children to his greatest creation, a time machine. Professor Bumble&#039;s attempt at recreating Benjamin Franklin&#039;s famous lightning experiment with the use of a kite flying outside the house to get the machine working only led up to SIR&#039;s temporary change in personality before sending the entire house on course for the past.The children never realized how long the journey back home would be due to Professor Bumble&#039;s misguidance and errors in time travel, but in the meantime they witnessed and participated (with little or no consequences) in numerous events in the Bible&#039;s New Testament, from John the Baptist&#039;s birth to the rise of the Apostle Paul.\"(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production","name":"Tatsunoko Production"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":52,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Apr 5, 1982","score":6.44,"members":769,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3969,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3969\/Kagaku_Kyuujo-tai_TechnoVoyager","title":"Kagaku Kyuujo-tai TechnoVoyager","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/11\/7158.jpg?s=6559b709c0a11cd314be1d08c21890e2","synopsis":"Thunderbirds 2086 takes place roughly twenty years after the original series (generally accepted as taking place around 2065, though other dates are seen on screen) and chronicles the adventures of the Thunderbirds, a rescue team working for the International Rescue Organisation.

No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher. There is a heavy intimation in the series that Star Crusher is not human and may be some kind of alien entity.(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":18,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space","name":"Space"}],"airing_start":"Apr 17, 1982, 19:30 (JST)","score":6.31,"members":504,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3880,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3880\/Makyou_Densetsu_Acrobunch","title":"Makyou Densetsu Acrobunch","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/11\/39313.jpg?s=b32a4f9d261736ba9445b3deabf169df","synopsis":"Led by scientist Tatsuya Randou, the Randou family undertakes a journey around the globe in order to search out ancient ruins to uncover the legend of Quetzalcoatl, which unlocks the key to a fabulous treasure.

As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/191\/Eiken","name":"Eiken"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":null,"source":"4-koma manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)","score":6.3,"members":2576,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":2257,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2257\/Taiyou_no_Kiba_Dagram","title":"Taiyou no Kiba Dagram","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/54511.jpg?s=176f61ccafa5d62de95985667048e2d7","synopsis":"The story is centered around a small group of guerilla freedom fighters on a colonial planet named Deployer, who are known as the \"Deployer 7\", or \"Sun Fang\" team.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation&#039;s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful.The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku&#039;s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history.While this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast.(Source: Pelleas)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC","name":"Group TAC"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1471,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Jan 7, 1976","score":6.36,"members":587,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3873,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3873\/Honey_Honey_no_Suteki_na_Bouken","title":"Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/6927.jpg?s=9b662b43db1758b95441047dabd4a710","synopsis":"Glamorous Paris, entrancing Venice, romantic Rome and irresistible Vienna...

The country was being torn apart by competing factions - modernizers trying to apply Western technology and ideas to Japanese society; Imperial loyalists, trying to reassert to the ascendancy of the Emperor; and the forces of the Shogunate, trying to defend the military bureaucracy (bakufu) against all comers. The bakufu organized special police squads, notably the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi, to \"defend public order\" and assassinate opponents. (In popular culture, they are all lumped together as the Shinsengumi.) Covert violence and even open warfare were commonplace.The movie covers 1866 and 1867. It tells the story of a retired samurai, Kumosuke (or Kumo, for short), who is living quietly, not to say idly, in Edo (old Tokyo) with his wife and two children, a young boy named Shinnosuke and an infant girl, Ohana. While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine. Kumo is forced to use his still-sharp sword skills to defend himself, but he&#039;d basically prefer to stay out of the treacherous political currents. Nonetheless, he ends up saving Ryouma Sakamoto (a famous Westernizer) from the Shinsengumi and teaching Ichimonji the futility of the warrior way.(Source: Soldado-Subs and Saizen)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse","name":"Madhouse"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation","name":"Toei Animation"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/21\/Samurai","name":"Samurai"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"}],"airing_start":"Apr 24, 1982","score":6.2,"members":645,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":10820,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10820\/Sengoku_Majin_Goushougun_Movie","title":"Sengoku Majin Goushougun (Movie)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/82706.jpg?s=026c536e43e95236a69398dacf890889","synopsis":"Compilation movie of the eponymous TV series.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/196\/Production_Reed","name":"Production Reed"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody","name":"Parody"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Apr 24, 1982","score":6.16,"members":294,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5933,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5933\/Shiroi_Kiba_White_Fang_Monogatari","title":"Shiroi Kiba White Fang Monogatari","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/11\/81828.jpg?s=44f8140590700d2a040b90b1d713fac4","synopsis":"White Fang is born on the planes of Alaska to a wolf father and a half-wolf, half-dog mother.
