But an international criminal group, Gallactor, tries to achieve world domination by taking control of the ISO. Gallactor was created by a mysterious being from outer space known as Generalissimo X, who gives orders through its chief commander on Earth, the masked Berg katse. To fight Gallactor and its robot monsters, the ISO&#039;s Dr. Nambu enlists five brave youths into a combat squad called Gatchaman,the Science Commandos. Special scientific powers and dramatic birdlike costumes make the Gatchaman Squad a match for Gallactor, wherever on Earth it may strike. Ken(the Eagle) is the wise leader, assisted by sometimes-foolhardy Joe(the Condor), pretty Jun(the Swan), eager little Jinpei(the Swallow), and strong Ryu(the Horned Owl). Each has individual scientific weapons, but their main power lies in their aircraft, the Phoenix, which can transform itself into a fiery arrow capable of piercing the most massive threats. GATCHAMAN is a series of dynamic action and tension as ken, Joe, Jun, Jinpei, and Ryu hold themselves in constant readiness to meet each new threat by Gallactor to conquer the world.(Source: Official Site)About Battle of the Planets (U.S.)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production","name":"Tatsunoko Production"}],"licensor":["ADV Films","Sentai Filmworks"],"episodes":105,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Oct 1, 1972","score":7.06,"members":5861,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":5311,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5311\/Astroganger","title":"Astroganger","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/57971.jpg?s=d1cc7757eb9dba9d5102a75922109387","synopsis":"An alien woman named Maya crash-lands on Earth.

Don&#039;t expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/191\/Eiken","name":"Eiken"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":null,"source":"4-koma manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)","score":6.3,"members":2576,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":8235,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8235\/Muumin_1972","title":"Muumin (1972)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/5\/47155.jpg?s=cd3a2f8491979d753b16afd7e436e3f0","synopsis":"A remake of the 1969-70 Moomin series.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.Throughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production","name":"Tatsunoko Production"}],"licensor":["Saban Entertainment"],"episodes":52,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"}],"airing_start":"Jan 4, 1972","score":5.89,"members":953,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":11275,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11275\/Akadou_Suzunosuke","title":"Akadou Suzunosuke","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/9\/56397.jpg?s=b428a0d665ae98cdbfeaae3ae149d6e2","synopsis":"A young swordsman finds himself involved in a plot to overthrow the shogunate.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":52,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"}],"airing_start":"Apr 5, 1972, 19:00 (JST)","score":5.93,"members":328,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3845,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3845\/Mahoutsukai_Chappy","title":"Mahoutsukai Chappy","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/8\/17490.jpg?s=d2333fe103565827b2fb7671321c2668","synopsis":"Chappy&#039;s story is much like Mahou Tsukai Sally (Little Witch Sally).
