Don&#039;t expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/191\/Eiken","name":"Eiken"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":null,"source":"4-koma manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Oct 5, 1969, 18:30 (JST)","score":6.3,"members":2576,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":6116,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6116\/Mainichi_Kaasan","title":"Mainichi Kaasan","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/4\/70931.jpg?s=93a2ac8429e15f8bf5bfbc009a6abb15","synopsis":"Based on Rieko Saibara&#039;s humorous semi-autobiographical manga about her life raising her two children.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":142,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Apr 1, 2009","score":7.63,"members":2048,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":6149,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6149\/Chibi_Maruko-chan_1995","title":"Chibi Maruko-chan (1995)","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/6\/13508.jpg?s=a4465bd946c243548e22cc207dcede99","synopsis":"Momoko Sakura is an elementary school student who likes popular idol Momoe Yamaguchi and mangas.

However the leader of the powerful mystic Buddhist Fuze Clan plans to stop the destruction of the negative karma which will end up creating the nine-headed Naaga and destroy the world if not the whole universe. To help in stopping the creation of the Naaga, the clan summons a Shinto god known as Susano, the Warrior God of Destruction. The powerful, arrogant, and homicidal god faces challenges. These include the Empire and the clan leader&#039;s own daughter, the bratty sorceress Seska, who is possessed by the power of the negative Karma and a powerful magic formula.(Source: Wikipedia)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/13\/Studio_4%C2%B0C","name":"Studio 4\u00b0C"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"}],"airing_start":"Jun 11, 2010","score":null,"members":305,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":17161,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/17161\/Peeping_Life__The_Perfect_Emotion_Special","title":"Peeping Life: The Perfect Emotion Special","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/45821.jpg?s=3742ef7ca7c3c3696591f30a1d13f86d","synopsis":"Special included in the Peeping Life: The Perfect Emotion&#039;s DVD release.","producer":[],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life","name":"Slice of Life"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"}],"airing_start":"Apr 16, 2010","score":5.31,"members":294,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":24789,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/24789\/Shoko_Nakagawa_Prism_Tour_Special","title":"Shoko Nakagawa Prism Tour Special","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/63733.jpg?s=c4bf991833ea058b05da1cb91cb2395d","synopsis":"A Sunrise-produced special created for Shoko Nakagawa&#039;s 2010 Prism Tour.","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise","name":"Sunrise"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":1,"source":"-","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music","name":"Music"}],"airing_start":"Apr ??, 2010","score":5.85,"members":240,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":32646,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32646\/Tsuzuki_wo_Kangaeru_Monogatari","title":"Tsuzuki wo Kangaeru Monogatari","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/2\/78363.jpg?s=6dd6c29d63f3fe3e91fd32c0098dedfd","synopsis":"A series of commercials created to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the SEKISUI Heim brand of modular homes.
