In a bid to raise their social status, their servant, a robotic cat named Doraemon, decides to travel back in time and guide Nobita on the proper path to fortune. Unfortunately Doraemon, a dysfunctional robot that the familly acquired by accident (but chose to keep nonetheless), isn&#039;t much better off than Nobita. The robot leads Nobita on many adventures, and while Nobita&#039;s life certainly is more exciting with the robot cat from the future, it is questionable if it is in fact better in the way that Doraemon planned.(Source: AniDB)Note: The series has been poorly preserved, and never released on any format, nor has it ever been re-aired.Nearly all the footage within the series (except for the opening and closing credits) was destroyed in an accidental fire sometime after the series was cancelled.Surviving reels from the show are occasionally shown at Doraemon fan conventions in Japan. In addition, the audio of several episodes still survives.

But an international criminal group, Gallactor, tries to achieve world domination by taking control of the ISO.

To fight Gallactor and its robot monsters, the ISO&#039;s Dr. Nambu enlists five brave youths into a combat squad called Gatchaman,the Science Commandos. Special scientific powers and dramatic birdlike costumes make the Gatchaman Squad a match for Gallactor, wherever on Earth it may strike. Ken(the Eagle) is the wise leader, assisted by sometimes-foolhardy Joe(the Condor), pretty Jun(the Swan), eager little Jinpei(the Swallow), and strong Ryu(the Horned Owl). Each has individual scientific weapons, but their main power lies in their aircraft, the Phoenix, which can transform itself into a fiery arrow capable of piercing the most massive threats.
