The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her friends. Even at only 5 years old, Ami-chan is easily the most rational of the group, and she&#039;s a little wary at first, but she eventually comes around and starts spending her free time with them. A typical day involves Ami-chan and the three doing different things to pass the time, often playing a seemingly innocent game, but in AniYoko style. Unfortunately for Ami-chan, the AniYoko version usually turns out to be drastically different, much less logical, and usually more dangerous than the ordinary version.(Source: ANN)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/36\/Studio_Gallop","name":"Studio Gallop"}],"licensor":[],"episodes":51,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy","name":"Comedy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo","name":"Shoujo"}],"airing_start":"Oct 4, 2005, 18:00 (JST)","score":7.03,"members":1734,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":7395,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7395\/Card_Wang__Mix_Master","title":"Card Wang: Mix Master","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/20195.jpg?s=4a1bf2c0c7708de2a59796a60e1187ef","synopsis":"Mix Masters is a Korea-Japan co-produced anime series, also known by the name Mix Master: King of Cards.
