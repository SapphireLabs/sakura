Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, Holo, who stylizes herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu,\" has been reduced to a mere folk tale. When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo&#039;s unusual ability to evaluate a person&#039;s character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.Based on the popular light novel of the same name, Ookami to Koushinryou, also known as Spice and Wolf, fuses the two polar genres of economics and romance to create an enthralling story abundant with elaborate schemes, sharp humor, and witty dialogue. Ookami to Koushinryou is more than just a story of bartering; it turns into a journey of searching for a lost identity in an ever-changing world.[Written by MAL Rewrite]","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/75\/Imagin","name":"Imagin"}],"licensor":["Funimation","Kadokawa Pictures USA"],"episodes":13,"source":"Light novel","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy","name":"Fantasy"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical","name":"Historical"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance","name":"Romance"}],"airing_start":"Jan 9, 2008, 01:30 (JST)","score":8.34,"members":432305,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":2993,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2993\/Rosario_to_Vampire","title":"Rosario to Vampire","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/75242.jpg?s=38c5d5df4c18313c6089aebd4828b4f0","synopsis":"Youkai Academy is a seemingly normal boarding school, except that its pupils are monsters learning to coexist with humans.

Of course, there&#039;s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car&#039;s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner&#039;s death. The manga follows Akio&#039;s various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.(Source: AniDB)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/179\/ACGT","name":"A.C.G.T."}],"licensor":[],"episodes":26,"source":"Manga","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/3\/Cars","name":"Cars"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen","name":"Seinen"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports","name":"Sports"}],"airing_start":"Jun 15, 2007","score":7.51,"members":14003,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1826,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1826\/Deltora_Quest","title":"Deltora Quest","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/88164.jpg?s=8eb944ed4ec7f572989709852b1a8dce","synopsis":"Long ago, the blacksmith Adin forged a belt of seven powerful gems, one from each of the seven tribes of Deltora.

The next day, mangled bodies are discovered in that same building, so torn apart that investigators find it infeasible to even consider the culprit human.Elsewhere, a client request reaches Touko Aozaki&#039;s detective agency, tasking Shiki Ryougi with either capturing or killing the perpetrator of last night&#039;s incident. But soon, word spreads that a single survivor escaped the slaughter, and now the murderer is plowing down everything in their path to locate and exterminate him. A brutal race against time begins, pitting Shiki against a dangerous foe imperceptible even to her legendary eyes.[Written by MAL Rewrite]","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/43\/ufotable","name":"ufotable"}],"licensor":["Aniplex of America"],"episodes":1,"source":"Light novel","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action","name":"Action"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery","name":"Mystery"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural","name":"Supernatural"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama","name":"Drama"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/41\/Thriller","name":"Thriller"}],"airing_start":"Feb 9, 2008","score":8.16,"members":132399,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":3848,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3848\/One_Piece_Movie_9__Episode_of_Chopper_Plus_-_Fuyu_ni_Saku_Kiseki_no_Sakura","title":"One Piece Movie 9: Episode of Chopper Plus - Fuyu ni Saku, Kiseki no Sakura","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/12\/25414.jpg?s=5ef640707321b0f26330d160608b4693","synopsis":"The movie is a retelling of the Drum Island arc with new music and animation.
