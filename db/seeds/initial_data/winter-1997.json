The only defense against these creatures is the secret agency known as the Gutsy Geoid Guard (or 3G) and their ultimate weapon, the awesome giant robot GaoGaiGar. GaoGaiGar&#039;s pilot, Guy Shishio, is a former astronaut who was nearly killed two years before when the Zonders first crashed to earth. Guy&#039;s life was spared when a mysterious robot lion called Galeon pulled him from the burning shuttle and brought him to Earth. Guy&#039;s father, Leo, then used Galeon&#039;s technology to rebuild his shattered son as a cyborg, in the hopes that he could stop the aliens when they appear. Now, with Galeon as its core, GaoGaiGar fights to protect Earth. He is aided by a team of transforming robots and by a young boy named Mamoru, who has the power to purify the Zonders&#039; cores, and seems to be connected to the mysterious Galeon.(Source: ANN)","producer":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise","name":"Sunrise"}],"licensor":["Media Blasters"],"episodes":49,"source":"Original","genre":[{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure","name":"Adventure"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha","name":"Mecha"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi","name":"Sci-Fi"},{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen","name":"Shounen"}],"airing_start":"Feb 1, 1997, 17:00 (JST)","score":7.92,"members":12143,"kids":false,"r18_plus":false},{"mal_id":1704,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1704\/Eat-Man","title":"Eat-Man","image_url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.cdn-dena.com\/r\/334x484\/images\/anime\/1\/1704.jpg?s=fd78ca0e58887951a92392f110a65fae","synopsis":"Meet Bolt Crank, mercenary extraordinaire, and the man who eats metal!
